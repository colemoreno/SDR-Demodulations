## SDR Demodulations
## Overview
- **Purpose**: The aim of this project is to provide different demodulation schemes for both AM and FM that use the RTL-SDR implemented in MATLAB.
- **Structure**: Within the directory there are different demodulation schemes. Each subdirectory will have its own README file and MATLAB code.
- **Requirements**: There are some hardware and software requirements that need to be completed before the program can compile and run.  
- **Constraints**: Each code only works with the RTL-SDR radio, the receiver that was used was the [Nooelec NESDR SMArt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GDN1T4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
